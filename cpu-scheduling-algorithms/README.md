This project implements core CPU scheduling algorithms in C as part of an Operating Systems laboratory. It includes First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF) in both preemptive and non-preemptive forms, and Round Robin (RR) scheduling. The implementations simulate process execution, generate Gantt charts, and compute key performance metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and completion time, enabling comparative analysis of fairness, efficiency, and responsiveness.
